ABSTRACT

This study investigates the influence of online assessment feedback on teacher-learner interactions and academic performance among preservice open distance learners. Specifically, it aims to examine how feedback in online assessments affects teacher-learner interaction and contributes to the academic performance of preservice teachers. The study was guided by the hypothesis that feedback in online formative assessments significantly affects the academic performance of preservice teachers. A descriptive survey design was employed, involving a sample of 160 preservice teachers from the Department of Education at the Distance Learning Institute, University of Lagos. Participants were selected from various cohorts, including Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Early Childhood Education, and English, using a simple random sampling technique to ensure diverse representation. Data were collected through a four-point Likert scale questionnaire, validated by the study supervisor, with responses ranging from "Strongly Agree" to "Strongly Disagree." Of the 160 questionnaires distributed, 157 were returned and considered valid for analysis. The data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation, and t-test statistics, with demographic information processed through frequency counts and percentages. The mean was utilized to address the research questions, while the t-test statistics were applied to test the null hypothesis at a 0.05 significance level. Additionally, Pearson product-moment correlation was used to assess the study's hypothesis. The study concludes that online assessment feedback significantly enhances both teacher-learner interactions and the academic performance of preservice teachers. It is recommended that institutions adopt comprehensive feedback mechanisms in online assessments to improve educational outcomes and foster effective teacher-learner engagement.
